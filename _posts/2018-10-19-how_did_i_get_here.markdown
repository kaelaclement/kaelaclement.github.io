Honestly I'm still working out exactly how I got here. Of course, I lived it; I know all the steps, but sometimes a solution has been in front of you all along and you wonder why you didn't see it before. I've been thinking lately it might help to review the spec file for my life, but I don't think that's part of the deal. The short story is this: a few years ago, my health had a very different life plan than I did. I was at beauty school, having a wonderful time working hard, formulating color, putting together the building blocks of a good cut and style, and watching my work touch someone's life. Then, all at once, I couldn't be on my feet all day. At the worst of it, I couldn't lift my arms to shoulder height.

 While I focused on healing, there was a whole lot I suddenly coudn't do. My entire life, for a time, was centered around what I couldn't do. Then it came time to figure out what I *could* do. So what were my building blocks now? Creativity, a love of learning, and an even greater love of figuring things out myself. With my health forever changed but greatly improved, I could finally look at the possibilities. Living in the San Francisco Bay Area, tech is everywhere. So when one of my friends inevitably said, "You should try coding," I did. I can't say I expected coding to touch on all the things I loved about doing hair, but somehow it did - and then some. It isn't always easy, but I fell in love just the same.
 
 Technology has always aimed to improve our lives. It saved my sanity time and again as I navigated illness, and continues to help me every day. With code, it's also brought back the love. My love of hard work is still there, thriving on every error message and Google search. The truth is, the possibilities are endless.
