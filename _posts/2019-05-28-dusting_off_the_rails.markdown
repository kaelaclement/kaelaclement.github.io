Here I am, on the other side of my Rails + JS project. While I'd already learned some vanilla JavaScript, everything from AJAX onward was new for me. Despite all that new technical knowledge, however, I think most of what I learned through this section was about myself. This section saw me learn about burnout, when to ask for help, and how resilient I really am.

Once it was time to actually do my project, I had a whole new set of skills to support me. It was a bit strange to see Rails again, but it all came back to me with ease I didn't expect. For the purpose of the project, my Rails backend didn't need a whole lot of work, especially with the help of ActiveModelSerializers (I even got to write a custom attribute). My Rails app has 3 models: Users, Recipes, and Reviews, and I decided that all requirements would be met on a single view - the user/show page. I knew right away I wanted to avoid how scattered I'd gotten with my Rails project, and being able to meet the requirements from a single view went a long way. It also, however, provided my greatest challenge. Getting the new review form was by far the stickiest point in the project. Honestly, though, it was a great reminder of how much I love getting to solve the puzzle when things break!

Like every project before it, I sit here mostly astounded by how much I really learned and how far I've come.
