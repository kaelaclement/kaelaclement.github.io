Ok, that was dramatic. But it's hard to think of a catchy way to say "no, really, study."

Long story short, we all have our strengths. Mine ended right around JavaScript. Despite previous knowledge, there were struggles. I didn't like how it behaves, I missed the database and all things server-side. In retrospect, it would be inaccurate to say I didn't understand what was going on, I knew a lot of the concepts and had little to no problem implementing them. But my natural disinclination took its toll - at times I felt completely lost. The trouble with feeling lost, was that I also had very little motivation to get un-lost. Why would I take the time to figure out what it was I didn't understand, or felt I didn't understand? By the time I got to my Rails + JS project, I would have been happy to never see JS again.

Only, that's not how that project works. [I've already written about my project](https://kaelaclement.github.io/dusting_off_the_rails), so I won't get into that, but that project assessment includes something new: a separate little quiz on JS. Now, every other review included questions on the basics: are you understanding object orientation, scope, the HTTP request/response cycle? With JavaScript, there would be more. All those things I managed to use but wasn't sure I was *really* understanding would now have some extra emphasis.

That's when a funny thing happened. Though I've done hours of fairly painless learning when it comes to backend topics, I can't say I'd ever studied so hard. Sometimes I even learned that the problem wasn't with my understanding, but with my dedication to the idea that JS quirks must have some motivation or use that no one was explaining to me. For as lost as I'd felt through some of the curriculum, suddenly my project was a breeze (in programming terms, of course...I still spent plenty of time with Broken Things). And my assessment? It was stressful, but I made it through infinitely better than I would have if I'd gotten my wish to never see JS again.

Now I approach my final project, and I will say that React & Redux aren't quite as painful. But I'm not sure I could say that if I hadn't decided to sit down and learn to enjoy my time with the things that are difficult. React and I still have our arguments (it's mostly just me, still understanding concepts and studying, but saying "why" at my screen over and over), but there are so many wonderful possibilities available to me now; and I can even say React is kind of beautiful.

So here's my big glorious point: on this bootcamp path we're doing an awful lot of fast-paced learning and growing as people while we push through. If the Slack chats are anything to go by, sometimes we forget to give ourselves that credit. So, fellow student or not, engineer or not, go out and study something you're not so fond of. Something you might put off but know would enhance your work or your life. Go study it and find the beautiful pieces you may have missed while you stomped your feet.

I'm sure I'm getting at some bigger life lesson here, but I'll leave that part to you. For now, just go learn.
